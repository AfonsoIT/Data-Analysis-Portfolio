## Projects
### Effect of Hyaluronan Molecular Weight on the Stability and Biofunctionality of Microfibers Assembled by Interfacial Polyelectrolyte Complexation
[Publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c18335)

Led a team in the development of a project to create microfibers based on hyaluronic acid and collagen. Interfacial Polyelectrolyte Complexation (IPC) was used, resulting in the production of bioactive and biocompatible fibers.
Employed advanced analytical tools, including a Goniometer, a Dynamic MechanicalAnalyzer (DMA), and various microscopy techniques to assess fiber properties. 
Conducted in vitro testing using cell cultures to evaluate the fibersâ€™ bioactivity andbiocompatibility. Underwent specialized training to properly maintain and handle cells incontrolled cell culture laboratories.
Produced and validated microfibers with promising properties for nerve tissue engineering,demonstrating their potential for neuronal regeneration applications.
